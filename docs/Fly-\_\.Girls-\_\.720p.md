During the Second World War, the United States Army Air Forces faced a shortage of male pilots for combat missions. To solve this problem, they decided to recruit and train civilian women pilots to perform noncombat duties such as ferrying, testing, instructing, and towing. This was the origin of the \*\*Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP)\*\*, a pioneering organization of about 1,100 women who became the first women to fly U.S. military aircraft .

The WASP was created in 1943 by merging two previous groups: the Women's Flying Training Detachment (WFTD) and the Women's Auxiliary Ferrying Squadron (WAFS). The WFTD was led by Jackie Cochran, a famous aviator who had flown a bomber to Britain and recruited American women for the British Air Transport Auxiliary. The WAFS was founded by Nancy Harkness Love, another accomplished pilot who had proposed the idea of using women to ferry planes from factories to bases .
  
The women of WASP had to meet high standards of physical and mental fitness, as well as having a commercial pilot's license and at least 500 hours of flying experience. They underwent rigorous military training and learned to fly various types of aircraft, from trainers and fighters to bombers and transports. They served at over 100 air bases across the country and flew over 60 million miles in total. They also faced many challenges and dangers, such as sexism, discrimination, sabotage, accidents, and fatalities. Thirty-eight WASP members died in service and one went missing .
  
The WASP program was disbanded in December 1944, as the war neared its end and male pilots became available again. The women were not recognized as veterans until 1977 and were awarded the Congressional Gold Medal in 2009. Their courage and contribution to the American war effort were largely unknown for decades, but they have since been honored and celebrated as trailblazers and role models for women in aviation  .

Here are some more paragraphs:
  
One of the most important and dangerous missions that the WASP performed was towing targets for live anti-aircraft gun practice. They flew planes that dragged a long sleeve behind them, while ground troops fired at the sleeve with real bullets and shells. Sometimes, the gunners missed the sleeve and hit the plane instead, causing damage or injury to the pilot. The WASP who towed targets had to wear special helmets and flak jackets to protect themselves from shrapnel and debris. They also had to fly in unpredictable patterns to avoid being shot down. Despite the risks, they completed thousands of towing missions and helped train many soldiers for combat .
  
Another challenging task that the WASP took on was testing new or repaired planes before they were sent to the front lines. They had to fly planes that had not been proven safe or reliable, and sometimes had to deal with mechanical failures or malfunctions. They also had to learn how to operate different kinds of aircraft quickly and efficiently, without much instruction or guidance. They tested planes such as the B-29 Superfortress, the P-51 Mustang, the P-38 Lightning, and the P-47 Thunderbolt. They proved that women could handle any type of plane that men could, and sometimes even better .
  
A third significant role that the WASP played was instructing male pilots and cadets on various aspects of flying. They taught them how to use instruments, navigate, communicate, and perform maneuvers. They also gave them check rides and evaluated their skills and progress. Some of the male students were reluctant or resentful to learn from women, but others were respectful and appreciative. The WASP instructors demonstrated their competence and professionalism, and earned the respect and admiration of many of their male colleagues. They also inspired many young women who dreamed of becoming pilots themselves .
